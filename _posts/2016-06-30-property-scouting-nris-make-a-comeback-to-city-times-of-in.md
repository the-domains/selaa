  HYDERABAD: Better times are ahead for the city's real estate sector. At least,
  so it seems from the renewed interest among Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in
  parking their moolah in upcoming ventures in 'hi-tech' Hyderabad. If some
  among them are genuine home-buyers, others are investors who have been sitting
  pretty on their money until now, say market analysts.
